# 🎓 University Network Model

This project simulates the internal communication infrastructure of a university using Cisco Packet Tracer. It includes the design and configuration of various departments, secure routing, IP addressing, and network segmentation to model a real-world academic network environment.

## 🧩 Features

- Departmental network separation
- IP addressing and subnetting
- Router and switch configuration
- VLAN implementation (if used)
- Basic routing between departments

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Networking Fundamentals (Routing, Switching, IP)
- Network Design & Simulation

## 🎯 Purpose

To understand and apply network design principles in a university setting, including communication flow, infrastructure planning, and secure IP allocation.

## 📂 Files Included

- `university-model.pkt` – Cisco Packet Tracer file
- `screenshots/` – Folder with topology images
